## Use with Claude Desktop

1) Open Claude Desktop settings and navigate to the “Developer” tab.
2) Click “Edit Config”.
3) Paste the configuration below (replace the API key).
4) Close and reopen Claude Desktop.
5) Verify the `resend` tool appears in the developer settings, then ask Claude to send an email using `resend`.

  </div>
  <div>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "resend": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "resend-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "RESEND_API_KEY": "re_xxxxxxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  </div>
</div>

> Optional: You can also point Claude Desktop (or Cursor) at a local build if you’re developing the server locally. Replace the `npx` command with `node ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PROJECT/dist/index.js`.

## Options

You can pass additional arguments to configure the server:

- `--key`: Your Resend API key (alternative to `RESEND_API_KEY` env var)
- `--sender`: Your sender email address from a verified domain
- `--reply-to`: Your reply-to email address

Environment variables:

- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Your Resend API key (required)
- `SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS`: Your sender email address from a verified domain (optional)
- `REPLY_TO_EMAIL_ADDRESS`: Your reply-to email address (optional)

> Note: If you don't provide a sender email address, the MCP server will ask you to provide one each time you call the tool.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure your API key is valid and has permission to send emails.
- To send to other addresses, verify your domain in Resend: https://resend.com/domains
- If you don’t see the `resend` tool:
  - Cursor: confirm the MCP server is added under Settings → MCP
  - Claude Desktop: confirm the Developer config is saved and app is restarted
