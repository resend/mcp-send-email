## Quickstart

1) Create a free Resend account and generate an API key.
- Create account: https://resend.com/
- API keys: https://resend.com/api-keys
- To send to other addresses, verify your domain: https://resend.com/domains

2) Add the MCP server in Cursor.

Open the command palette (cmd+shift+p on macOS or ctrl+shift+p on Windows) → “Cursor Settings” → “MCP” → “Add new global MCP server”, then use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "resend": {
      "type": "command",
      "command": "npx -y resend-mcp",
      "env": {
        "RESEND_API_KEY": "re_xxxxxxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3) Ask your AI to email.

Open a chat in Cursor and say something like: “Send me an email summarizing today’s tasks using the resend tool.” Cursor will invoke the MCP server and send via Resend.

## Options

You can pass additional arguments to configure the server:

- --key: Your Resend API key (alternative to RESEND_API_KEY env var)
- --sender: Your sender email address from a verified domain
- --reply-to: Your reply-to email address

Environment variables:

- RESEND_API_KEY: Your Resend API key (required)
- SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS: Your sender email address from a verified domain (optional)
- REPLY_TO_EMAIL_ADDRESS: Your reply-to email address (optional)

Note: If you don't provide a sender email address, the MCP server will ask you to provide one each time you call the tool.

## Local development (optional)

Prefer to run from source instead of npx? Build the project and point Cursor to your local `dist/index.js`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "resend": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PROJECT/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "RESEND_API_KEY": "re_xxxxxxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
